### üéì Teaching Assistant Experience  
As a Teaching Assistant (TA), I‚Äôve had the privilege of guiding and mentoring students in several core courses, helping them grasp complex concepts and develop practical skills in the field of digital technologies. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of my TA roles:  

#### **Digital Signal Processing (Autumn, Lead by Dr.Ahmad Chaddad)**  
- Assisted students in understanding fundamental and advanced concepts such as Fourier transforms, filter design, and signal modulation.  
- Conducted lab sessions, troubleshooting code implementations in MATLAB and Python.  
- Provided one-on-one support to students, helping them debug algorithms and optimize their solutions.  

#### **Digital System Design (Autumn, Lead by Dr.Ahmad Chaddad)**  
- Guided students through the design and implementation of digital circuits using Verilog and FPGA tools.  
- Facilitated hands-on labs, focusing on topics like combinational and sequential logic, state machines, and memory systems.  
- Reviewed and graded assignments, providing detailed feedback to help students improve their designs.  

#### **Digital Image Processing (Spring, Lead by Dr.Ahmad Chaddad)**  
- Supported students in mastering image processing techniques such as filtering, edge detection, and morphological operations.  
- Led workshops on implementing algorithms using Python (OpenCV, NumPy) and MATLAB.  
- Assisted in the development of final projects, encouraging creativity and practical application of course material.
